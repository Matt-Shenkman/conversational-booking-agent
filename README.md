# Chrono: Conversational Scheduling Assistant

Chrono (named after greek god of time Chronos) is a conversational AI assistant that helps users find and book available Calendly time slots through natural dialogue. It uses OpenAI's GPT to understand user intent and Playwright to automate interactions with Calendly.

- Natural language interface for scheduling
- Real-time scraping of Calendly availability using Playwright
- Query by specific months (`YYYY-MM` format)
- Restricts bookings to the current month + next 2 months

## ðŸ§  Assistant Logic

- Defaults to querying the **current month plus two** if no months are specified.
- Assistant only allows booking of times that were confirmed as available.
- Assistant will **only call `getSlotsForMonths` once per session if specified**, unless:
  - A booking fails due to an invalid date/time
  - The user explicitly requests availability for another month that wasn't previously queried.
- User must **confirm name, email, and time** before a booking is attempted.

## ðŸ’¬ Sample Conversation

```
You: Show me slots for July.
Chrono: ðŸ—“ Available slots for July...
You: Iâ€™d like to book Wednesday at 10:30am.
Chrono: Just to confirm â€” Name: Matt Shenkman, Email: mattshenkman@gmail.com, Time: Wednesday at 10:30am. Confirm?
You: Confirm
Chrono: âœ… Booking confirmed!
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Debug Tips

- If scraping fails, inspect or update selectors in `getSuggestedSlots.js` and `tryBookSlot.js`.
- Use `console.log` in each function to trace behavior.
- Use `DEBUG=1 node index.js` to add your own conditional logs.
- I left debug statements on for now as they provide additional context on to requests. Would turn them off in prod.
